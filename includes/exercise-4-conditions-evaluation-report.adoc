In this exercise, you'll learn how to leverage Spring Boot's Conditions Evaluation Report to understand why certain auto-configurations are applied or not. This is especially useful when troubleshooting unexpected behavior in your application.

=== Learnings
- **How to enable and interpret the Conditions Evaluation Report**
- **How to identify why certain beans are or aren't loaded**

=== Task

. Enable debug mode in your application to view the Conditions Evaluation Report:
+
[source,properties]
----
debug=true
----
+
This can be added to your `application.properties` file or passed as a command-line argument using `--debug`.

. Start your application. Upon startup, you should see a detailed report in the console that looks like:
+
[source]
----
===========================
CONDITIONS EVALUATION REPORT
===========================

Positive matches:
-----------------
   ...

Negative matches:
-----------------
   ...
----
+
This report lists all auto-configuration classes with their conditions, and they were applied or not.

. Review the report to understand which configurations were applied and which were not, along with the reasons.

. Use this information to troubleshoot any unexpected behavior or to verify that your custom configurations are being considered appropriately.

=== Conclusion

The Conditions Evaluation Report is a powerful tool for diagnosing configuration issues in Spring Boot applications. By understanding which conditions are met or not, you can gain insights into the auto-configuration process and ensure your application behaves as expected.

=== Solution
