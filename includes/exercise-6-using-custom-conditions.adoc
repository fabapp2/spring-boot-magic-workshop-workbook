It is also possible to create custom conditions like the existing `@On...` conditions from Spring Boot.

Let's create a custom condition that checks the system property `my.custom.condition` - just because it's simple.
But imagine you have a more sophisticated custom check here, e.g., infrastructure checks like the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/endpoints.html#actuator.endpoints.kubernetes-probes[Kubernetes probes].
Or you could write a condition which triggers only on 1st of April.

Oh, the possibilities!

=== Learnings
- **How to create your own conditions**
- **How to use that custom condition**

=== Task

. Create a new annotation `@MyCustomCondition` in the `{auto-config}` module. It must have a `@Target` of `TYPE` and `METHOD` and a `@Retention` of `RUNTIME` (you can also copy that from Spring Boot's `@ConditionalOnProperty`).

. The newly created annotation must be annotated with `@Conditional({OnCustomCondition.class})`.

. A new class, `OnCustomCondition` must be created. It should extend Spring Boot's `SpringBootCondition`.

. The `getMatchOutcome` method must be overriden and should check the `my.custom.condition` system property. Use `ConditionOutcome.match` and `ConditionOutcome.noMatch` to signal if the condition matches or not.

. Modify the `GreetingAutoConfiguration` to use the new `@MyCustomCondition`. A bean of class `BeepGreetingService` (located in the `{slf4j}` module) should be created if `@MyCustomCondition` matches.

. Test that the application works by setting the system property `my.custom.condition` and verify that the `BeepGreetingService` bean is used.

NOTE: You'll have to set `workshop.greeting.type` to something else than `logger` or `stdout`, because otherwise the `LoggerGreetingService` or `StdOutGreetingService` is also created.

=== Detailed Steps

[%collapsible]
====

. Create a new annotation in the `{auto-config}` module, called `MyCustomCondition`

. Annotate the annotation with `@Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD})` and with `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)`

. Annotate the annotation with `@Conditional({OnCustomCondition.class})`

. Create a class called `OnCustomCondition` and let it extend `SpringBootCondition`

. Implement the `getMatchOutcome` method
..  Use `System.getProperty("my.custom.condition")` to read the `my.custom.condition` system property
..  If the value of that property is `true`, return `ConditionOutcome.match` to signal that the condition matches
..  Otherwise, return `ConditionOutcome.noMatch` to signal that the condition didn't match

. Add a new `@Bean` method to the `GreetingAutoConfiguration` class, call it `beepGreetingService`, its return type is `GreetingService`
..  Annotate this new method with `@MyCustomCondition`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` and `@ConditionalOnClass(BeepGreetingService.class)`
..  Return a new instance of `BeepGreetingService` from that method

. To test the custom condition, you can add `System.setProperty("my.custom.condition", "true");` as first line in the `main` method, or you can set the system properties when starting with your IDE

. You'll also need to add `workshop.greeting.type=none` to your `application.properties`, because otherwise the `LoggerGreetingService` or the `StdOutGreetingService` would be created

=== Conclusion
Can you image why it is useful to create custom conditions?

====
Creating your own conditions is useful if the conditions from Spring Framework and Spring Boot don't fit your needs.
Custom conditions show the power of an extensible framework like the Spring Framework.
There's no "magic" behind the built-in Spring Boot conditions â€” they are built on the same foundations like your custom condition is.

NOTE: You can take a look at the `@Profile` annotation from Spring Framework: The logic is implemented in `ProfileCondition`, and it essentially returns `true` if the profile is activated and `false` if not.
