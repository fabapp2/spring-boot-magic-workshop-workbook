In this exercise, you will make the existing `LoggerGreetingService` available as an auto-configured bean â€” but only when the corresponding class is on the classpath. You will also adjust the fallback behavior of `StdOutGreetingService` so it is only used when the SLF4J-based implementation is not present.

This pattern mimics common practices in Spring Boot where auto-configured beans adapt to the available classpath.

=== Learnings
- **How to auto-configure beans conditionally based on classpath presence**
- **How to combine `@ConditionalOnClass` and `@ConditionalOnMissingClass`**
- **How to selectively expose features outside the default starter**

=== Task

. In the {auto-config} module add a optiÃ³nal dependency to {slf4j}.

. In the `GreetingAutoConfiguration`, register an additional `GreetingService` bean that returns a `LoggerGreetingService` instance.

. Annotate this method with:
- `@ConditionalOnClass(LoggerGreetingService.class)` â€” to create a bean only if `LoggerGreetingService` is on the classpath.
- `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` â€” to allow overriding by users.

. Update the existing `StdOutGreetingService` bean:
- Add `@ConditionalOnMissingClass("com.workshop.magic.service.slf4j.LoggerGreetingService")` â€” to create the bean only if `LoggerGreetingService` is not on the classpath.

. Ensure the module `{slf4j}` is **not** included in the `{starter}` module.

. In the `{app}` module, add a Maven dependency to `{slf4j}`.

. âœ… Start the app: You should see _LoggerGreetingService: Hola Spring I/O Barcelona_.

. Remove the `{slf4j}` Maven dependency again:

. âœ… Start the app: You should now see _StdOutGreetingService: Hola Spring I/O Barcelona_.

. In the `GreetingAutoConfiguration` class, add this bean method:

    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnMissingBean
    @ConditionalOnClass(LoggerGreetingService.class)
    GreetingService slf4jGreetingService() {
        return new LoggerGreetingService();
    }

. On the existing `stdOutGreetingService()` method, add:

    @ConditionalOnMissingClass("com.workshop.magic.service.slf4j.LoggerGreetingService")

. Make sure the `{auto-config}` module declares a dependency to `{slf4j}` with:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.workshop</groupId>
        <artifactId>library-slf4j</artifactId>
        <optional>true</optional>
    </dependency>

. In the `{starter}` module, ensure `{slf4j}` is **not** added as a dependency. Only `{api}` (not necessarily needed, as it comes transitively through `{stdout}`), `{stdout}`, and `{auto-config}` should be included.

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.workshop</groupId>
        <artifactId>library-autoconfigure</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.workshop</groupId>
        <artifactId>library-api</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.workshop</groupId>
        <artifactId>library-stdout</artifactId>
    </dependency>

. Make sure the `{app}` module declares a dependency to `{slf4j}` with:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.workshop</groupId>
        <artifactId>library-slf4j</artifactId>
    </dependency>

. Run the application. `LoggerGreetingService` is now used, as it's on the classpath. The `StdOutGreetingService` bean isn't created, as `LoggerGreetingService` is on the classpath.

. Remove the `{slf4j}` dependency from the app module and re-run it.

. `StdOutGreetingService` is now used, as `LoggerGreetingService` is not on the classpath.

=== Conclusion

This pattern of classpath-based behavior is common in real-world Spring Boot libraries. It allows default behavior that can be changed or enhanced by simply adding another dependency â€” without requiring configuration or code changes.

ðŸ¤” Can you think of an example where it is done this way?

Spring Boot uses classpath detection extensively to toggle features.
For example, if Hibernate is on the classpath, JPA support is auto-configured.
If it isn't, Spring Boot silently skips it.
This reduces configuration overhead and provides smart defaults that adapt to the environment.

The `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` starter doesn't include a database driver, because the Spring Boot team doesn't want to force a database choice on you.
You'll need to add one for yourself, for example adding `org.postgresql:postgresql` auto-configures a `DataSource` which can talk to PostgreSQL.
